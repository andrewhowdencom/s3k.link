# Versioning 

The API provides multiple different API versions, which indicate what you should expect (in terms of stability)

* **dev**: Under active development. Backwards incompatible changes essentially guaranteed
* **alpha${N}**: Under testing. Backwards incompatible changes made freely, without notice. Version will be incremented.
* **beta${N}**: Under early customer user. Backwards incompatible changes avoided, but will be made where necessary.
* **v${N}**: Public consumption. Backwards incompatible changes never made. Endpoints may be removed, but never changed.
