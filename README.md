## Understanding this work

This project functions as a demonstration of work. In the future, I will likely cannibalize it for the
[Practical Introduction to Observability](h4n.link/pito). In it, you can see:

**üìà Algorithmic Complexity**

You'll see different implementations of the same problem ‚Äî
[finding a URL in a set](https://github.com/andrewhowdencom/x40.link/tree/main/storage/memory). There is the
naive, [linear implementation](https://github.com/andrewhowdencom/x40.link/blob/main/storage/memory/linear_search.go),
a [binary search implementation](https://github.com/andrewhowdencom/x40.link/blob/main/storage/memory/binary_search.go),
and the one we'd
actually use ‚Äî a very [simple hashmap](https://github.com/andrewhowdencom/x40.link/blob/main/storage/memory/hash_table.go).
There are even benchmarks to
[validate their performance!](https://github.com/andrewhowdencom/x40.link/blob/main/storage/storage_test.go#L87-L149)

**üìñ Documentation**

Learn more about the project, including how to solve specific problems, through the documentation website at
[x40.dev](https://www.x40.dev). This documentation follows the goal-oriented
[Divio documentation structure](https://documentation.divio.com/) to help users of the documentation find what
they're looking for quickly, as well as allow developers to add documentation in a structured way that does
not become a mess over time.

**‚ôæÔ∏è Functional Arguments**

Look at [the BoltDB-backed URL storage](https://github.com/andrewhowdencom/x40.link/blob/main/storage/boltdb/boltdb.go#L26)
and see the variadic argument approach [popularized by Dave Cheany](https://dave.cheney.net/2014/10/17/functional-options-for-friendly-apis)
and in broad use at [Uber](https://github.com/uber-go/guide/blob/master/style.md#functional-options).

**‚úçÔ∏è Helpful commit messages**

Read the [commit history to understand my thinking](https://github.com/andrewhowdencom/x40.link/commits/main/) while
writing each unit of work. You can see how the thinking has changed over time! You can read more
[about why I think this is so important](https://medium.com/@andrewhowdencom/anatomy-of-a-good-commit-message-acd9c4490437)

**üöÜ Infrastructure as Code**

Look at the [infrastructure as code](https://github.com/andrewhowdencom/x40.link/tree/main/deploy/prod/tf) definitions,
using the [Tofu](https://opentofu.org/) (or open-source Terraform implementation) infrastructure tool to
[create DNS records](https://github.com/andrewhowdencom/x40.link/blob/main/deploy/prod/tf/dns.tf). See how it is
[configured to store its state in Google Cloud.](https://github.com/andrewhowdencom/x40.link/blob/main/deploy/prod/tf/state.tf)

You can check the infrastructure by visiting the managed domains with:

* **docs**: https://x40.dev
* **app**: https://x40.link

**ü§ñ Task Runner**

Run tasks via the [Taskfile](https://github.com/andrewhowdencom/x40.link/blob/main/Taskfile.yml) from the excellent
[Task Files](https://taskfile.dev/) project and see how to build the application, including for different
operating systems. Get a better understanding of the available tasks via:

```bash
$ task --list
```

Command, or learn more about each task with:

```bash
$ task --summary <task>
```

**üß™ Test Driven Development**

Take a look around at the files
[suffixed with _test](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aandrewhowdencom%2Fx40.link+path%3A_test.go&type=code). You'll
see the popular "table-driven test" format, with many tests being invoked in parallel to ensure fast execution and concurrency safety.
You'll also see the occasional
[benchmark](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aandrewhowdencom%2Fx40.link+path%3A_test.go+Benchmark&type=code), as well
as well as some
[testable examples](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aandrewhowdencom%2Fx40.link+path%3A_test.go+Example&type=code).
You can learn more on [the go website](https://go.dev/blog/examples). Some tests even validate concurrency via
[the go race detector](https://go.dev/blog/race-detector) and `go test -race`!

### ‚ùì Remaining Work

Quite a bit of work remains in this project before it becomes "production-ready!" For example,

1. The definition of the project as a container
3. The configuration of a public cloud (e.g., Terraform)
4. Observability instrumentation (e.g., logs, metrics, traces, profiling)
5. Data Backups (e.g. Scheduled, Commit Logs and so on)
6. Service Level Management (e.g., SLOs, SLAs)

I have worked with all of these technologies before; however, I have only a limited number of daily hours! Perhaps
you can [email me](mailto:hello@andrewhowden.com), and I can help you find evidence of what you're looking for.
