# s3k.link

A short link service because Firebase dynamic links are [going away].

## Why

There are a few problems that this project solves. These include:

### Technical Interview Practice / Demonstration of Work

My recent months of work haven't been so focused on writing code, and the years before that were mainly as a manager.
While I think I can probably write "reasonable" code, hiring managers will probably assess my code in 60-minute slots.
I'd rather not get stuck trying to remember something and, instead, get "as much" of the interview done as possible.

Lovely hiring managers, if you do find this work: You can see samples of my approach by reading
[the git history for the project](https://github.com/andrewhowdencom/s3k.link/commits/main). I have strong feelings
[about preserving history via version control](https://medium.com/@andrewhowdencom/anatomy-of-a-good-commit-message-acd9c4490437).

### Practical Introduction to Observability

The original example for the practical introduction to observability requires much work and has only a single
vertical to "pay off." Short links work just as well as an example, can be deployed for "real" in a "production"
environment, and solves some problems I have with Firebase (such as Firebase Dynamic Links going away).

The course will likely use this as a "persistent example" in the future.

## Name

So, what does S3K stand for? Well, nothing. It was supposed to be "S3T" for "s[hor]t.link", however, I hadn't slept too
well on the night that I created this, and thus, it became "s3k".

Let's call it "skink link". [Skinks] are a kind of lizard that used to hang around near where I grew up.
