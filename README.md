## Name

So, what does S3K stand for? Well, nothing. It was supposed to be "S3T" for "s[hor]t.link", however, I hadn't slept too
well on the night that I created this, and thus, it became "s3k".

Let's call it "skink link". [Skinks] are a kind of lizard that used to hang around near where I grew up.

## Architecture

There isn't one. I need to uh, write it first.
